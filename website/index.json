    "summary": "Dynamic Placeholders in PDMShell Overview The Dynamic Placeholders feature in PDMShell allows you to substitute values dynamically using placeholders. This functionality is supported by several commands and enables the use of file or folder properties, system variables, and other contextual information to generate new values automatically. Dynamic Placeholders are not a standalone command but a feature used by specific commands to process the value parameter or other relevant inputs. Commands Supporting Dynamic Placeholders The following commands support the use of dynamic placeholders: Commands Using the Current Folder as the Backing Object (directory parameter): cd: Change the current directory. mkdir: Create a new directory. export: Export commands to a file. addtvault: Add a vault with the directory as the backing object. Commands Using Files or Folders as the Backing Object: rename: Uses the value parameter for renaming files or folders. renamefromsource: The new file is evaluated if the evaluatealiases parameter is specified. setvar: Uses the value parameter to set variables for files or folders. bom: Uses the name parameter to set the exported bom csv name. export: Uses the name parameter to set the exported files name pattern. Placeholders for Dynamic Substitution The value parameter in supported commands can include placeholders that are dynamically replaced with actual values based on the context. The placeholders differ slightly depending on whether the backing object is a file or a folder. Placeholders for Files $value: Existing value of the variable. $name: The file name with extension. $namewithoutextension: The file name without extension. $extension: The file extension. $id: The file ID. $revision: The current revision of the file (PDM revision, not the PDM variable). $version: The current version of the file. $fullyqualifiedname: The full local path of the file. $fullyqualifiedfoldername: The full local path of the folder containing the file. $foldername: The name of the folder containing the file. $configuration: configuration name. Only valid for BOM command. Placeholders for Folders $value: Existing value of the variable. $name: The folder name. $foldername: The name of the parent folder. $id: The folder ID. $fullyqualifiedname: The full local path of the folder. Common Placeholders (Applicable to Both Files and Folders) $username: The name of the logged-in user. $vaultname: The name of the vault. $yyyy: The current year. $mm: The current month (two digits). $hh: The current hour (two digits). $mi: The current minute (two digits). $ss: The current second (two digits). $date: The current date. $time: The current time in the current locale. $guid: Unique identifier. Using Variables in Dynamic Placeholders In addition to placeholders, you can include other variables by enclosing them in square brackets (e.g., [VariableName]). These variables are dynamically resolved based on the context of the file or folder. Example Usage Here’s an example of how to use dynamic placeholders in a command: Renaming a File rename -filePath 1.sldprt -value \"$nameWithoutExtension_$yyyy$mm$dd$extension\""

Requires the logged-in user to have the permission: Modify revision numbers (EdmSysRight_ModifyRevisionNumbers). referencescheck Runs PDM’s Reference Check. This detects: Missing references Wrong versions Outdated references Broken or invalid reference paths Any issues found are stored in an internal list and may be exported via the csv parameter. csv Exports reference-check issues to a CSV file. If the file exists in the vault, it is updated. If the file does not exist, it is added to the vault. The CSV contains: ParentFileID,RefFileID,ParentPath,RefPath,RefVersion,RefLatestVersion,RefFolderID Behavior notes for CSV: Fully-qualified paths inside the vault are handled correctly. CSV escaping is applied (quotes, commas, newlines). UTF-8 encoding without BOM is used for compatibility. If the CSV file is checked out, a warning is returned. WORKFLOW OVERVIEW 1. Search for files The command executes a PDM search using the supplied query and optional recursion. 2. Perform requested operations Depending on parameters: -bumprevision → increments the PDM revision counters -referencescheck → checks all references for correctness 3. CSV Export (optional) If both search and referencescheck are supplied, and csv is specified: Writes reference errors to a CSV Adds or updates the file in the vault Displays success, warnings, and error messages NOTES: bumprevision and referencescheck operate only on files returned by the search. CSV exporting is only active when both search and referencescheck are supplied. The reference check output may include many entries depending on assembly depth. This command does not modify file content — it only updates revision metadata or reference validation results. Bulk operations respect PDM permissions and may fail if the user lacks rights.

    "summary": "PDMShell Advanced Search Guide PDMShell provides a complete search engine based on PDM's own search. This feature is extremely useful with commands that have a -search parameter. This guide explains how the -search parameter works, how to use tokens, variables, operators, and how PDMShell parses and applies search rules. Wildcards in PDMShell (SQL-Style Pattern Matching) PDMShell supports the same wildcard patterns used in SOLIDWORKS PDM and standard SQL-like matching rules. These allow you to control how filenames are matched inside any -search query. Wildcard Meaning Example Result % Matches zero or more characters %.sldprt Returns all part files _ Matches exactly one character pump_.sldprt Matches pump1.sldprt, pumpA.sldprt, not pump10.sldprt 1. Overview The -search parameter accepts simple text queries or advanced multi-condition expressions that filter files and folders using PDM system tokens and variable values. 2. Simple Searches If no operators are present, the entire input is treated as a Name filter. Examples: pump.sldprt # Searches for files explicitly named pump.sldprt assembly_1001 # Searches for any file whose name contains 'assembly_1001' %.sldasm # Searches for all SOLIDWORKS assembly files in the current folder Equivalent to: Name=pump.sldprt Name=passembly_1001 Name=%.sldasm 3. Advanced Syntax Multiple conditions are separated using semicolons. Example: Name=%Pump%;Recursive=true;VersionsBefore=20200101 # Finds files with 'Pump' in the name, searches subfolders, and only returns versions created before Jan 1st 2020 Note Dates must follow the yyyMMdd format. Escaping rules: \\; inserts a semicolon \\= inserts an equals sign \\\\ inserts a literal backslash Example: Name=Valve\\=A;Label=Released\\;Approved # Searches for files literally named \"Valve=A\" and having a label containing the text \"Released;Approved\" 4. Built-in Search Tokens These tokens map directly to EdmSearchToken values and control how PDMShell filters PDM objects. Table: Supported Search Tokens Token Description Name File or folder name filter AllVersions Search all versions ContentText Full-text content search string ContentTextExact Exact match of content ContentTextInBody Search inside file body ContentTextInProperties Search in custom properties ContentTextOr Match any word FindFiles Include files in results FindFolders Include folders in results FindItems Include items in results FolderID Starting folder ID HistoryAfter Search history after date HistoryBefore Search history before date HistoryString History string search HistoryStringConfiguration Search configuration names HistoryStringFileName Search file names in history HistoryStringLabels Search labels in history HistoryStringRevisionComment Search revision comments HistoryStringStateComment Search state change comments HistoryStringVariableValues Search variable changes HistoryStringVersionComment Search version comments Label Search label text LabelAfter Labels after date LabelBefore Labels before date LabelByUser Labels created by user LabelComment Search label comment Locked Return checked-out files LockedBy Return files locked by user Recursive Include subfolders StateAfter State changes after date StateBefore State changes before date StateByUser User who changed state StateHistoric Search historic states StateID Workflow state ID StateName Workflow state name Unlocked Return checked-in files VersionComment Search version comment VersionsAfter Versions after date VersionsBefore Versions before date VersionsByUser Versions created by user WorkflowName Search by workflow name 5. Default Behavior FolderID defaults to the active directory. Recursive defaults to the global flag. FindFolders defaults to the includefolders flag. FindFiles is always true. 6. Variable Search Conditions beginning with @ use PDM variables. Format: @VariableName Operator Value Examples: @Description=Pump # Variable 'Description' must equal \"Pump\" @Weight>=10 # Numeric variable 'Weight' must be greater than or equal to 10 @Revision!=A # Variable 'Revision' must NOT be \"A\" @Material~Steel # Variable 'Material' must contain the text \"Steel\" @ProjectCode!~TEST # Variable 'ProjectCode' must NOT contain the text \"TEST\" PDMShell automatically: Detects the operator Extracts variable name and value Looks up the variable definition using IEdmVariable5 Determines the variable type Converts the value to the correct type Selects the appropriate EdmVarOp_* enum Applies AddVariable2 7. Supported Variable Operators PDMShell supports all major comparison operators for variables. Table: Supported Operators Symbol Meaning = Equal != Not equal <> Not equal > Greater than < Less than >= Greater or equal <= Less or equal ~ Contains !~ Does not contain 8. Variable Operator-to-Enum Mapping Table: String Variable Operator Mapping Symbol Enum = Equals != / <> Different > Greater < Less >= Greater or equal <= Less or equal ~ Contains !~ Not contains Numeric and date types use the corresponding numeric/date enum sets. Dates must be in the format: yyyyMMdd 9. Operator Detection Operators are detected longest-first to avoid ambiguity. Table: Operator Detection Order Order Operator 1 >= 2 <= 3 != 4 <> 5 !~ 6 ~ 7 > 8 < 9 = This ensures >= is not incorrectly parsed as >. 10. Combining Tokens and Variables Tokens and variable conditions can be mixed: Name=%Pump%;@Description~Steel;StateName=Released;@Weight>=5 # Files with names containing 'Pump', description containing 'Steel', state equal to Released, and weight >= 5 All conditions must match. 11. Invalid Input Handling Invalid expressions are ignored silently. PDMShell continues applying valid conditions. Examples ignored: @MissingVar=Test HistoryBefore=BADDATE UnknownKey=Value 12. Examples Search by name: Name=%Valve% # Finds all files whose name contains 'Valve' Search by folder: Name=%Valve%;FolderID=102 # Same search, but restricted to folder with ID 102 Variable contains: @Description~Pump # Matches files where Description contains the text 'Pump' Token and variable together: StateName=Approved;@Revision!=A # Files in state 'Approved' AND Revision variable not equal to 'A' More complex: Name=%Pump%;@Material~Steel;@Weight>=15;Recursive=true;VersionsBefore=20200101 # Files with 'Pump' in the name, Material containing 'Steel', Weight >= 15, # include subfolders, and versions created before Jan 1st 2020 13.

    "title": "Notes About Running PDMShell in Single Instance Mode | SOLIDWORKS PDM | Powershell like features for SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional",
    "summary": "Notes About Running PDMShell in Single Instance Mode PDMShell can run in two modes: Multi Instance Mode (default) Single Instance Mode (one controller instance, all commands routed to it) Single instance mode is useful when you want: faster execution for multiple commands automation pipelines that require sequential execution Single Instance Mode Overview To enable Single Instance Mode, start PDMShell using: pdmcli.exe /single or pdmcli.exe -single When PDMShell is running in Single Instance Mode, you’ll see a single-instance indicator in the top-right corner of the window. It shows a “1” icon, confirming that all commands will be routed to this instance from other single instances. If PDMShell is not running in single instance mode, the indicator will display an infinity symbol (∞), meaning multiple PDMShell instances are allowed and each command launches independently in its own PDMShell process. With single instance, you can: ✅ launch PDMShell as a single instance controller ✅ allow subsequent commands to reuse the same PDMShell instance ✅ improve performance if triggered from cmd.exe or Dispatch ✅ prevent multiple conflicting PDMShell instances UAC, Permissions, and Single Instance Mode PDMShell’s Single Instance Mode relies on Windows’ global mutex system. Because of this, User Account Control (UAC) and process elevation matter. To attach to the single instance, you must ensure that: If the first instance is started as Admin, all following calls must also run as Admin If the first instance is started without elevation, all following calls must also run without elevation Warning Avoid running PDMShell as a Windows Administrator if you have custom add-ins installed. Check-in and check-out commands can create instances of your add-in inside the host application's memory. If the add-in was registered under a different user or UAC level, PDM will throw a “Class not registered” error. Executing Commands in Single Instance Mode Once PDMShell is running with /single, all subsequent calls to pdmcli.exe must also include /single, or PDMShell will launch a new instance instead of attaching. Example: pdmcli.exe /single \"help command checkout\" This will: connect to the already running instance execute help command checkout return output immediately Important When calling from cmd.exe, /single or -single cannot be contained in the double quote. Tips for Single Instance Mode Always include /single in every call Use proper quote escaping when calling from Dispatch Use Single Instance mode for sequences of operations Use Multi Instance mode for isolated one-shot commands"

SYNTAX: cd [-directory|-id] PARAMETERS: directory: The directory to switch to. The directory parameter can be a relative or absolute path in PDM. id: ID of the folder to navigate to. EXAMPLES: cd -directory 'C:\\Vault\\NewFolder' # Navigates to NewFolder cd -id 755 # Navigates to the folder with ID 755 REMARKS: Use cd.. to navigate to the parent folder or cd\\ to navigate to the root of the vault. If you just created a new folder and want to cd to it using autocomplete, use the dir command with the -refresh parameter to reload the session. directory is the default parameter, so you don’t need to specify it if it’s the only parameter in your command. Case Sensitivity As of PDMShell 3.0.1, all command names, parameter names, and values are case-sensitive. Escaping Quotes Escaping quotes when passing arguments to PDMShell depends on where the command originates. Please read this dedicated article.

Example Script Below is an example of a .pdmshell script: # filepath: example.pdmshell # This script automates exporting and adding files to the vault. # Navigate to the working directory cd \"\\api\\sandbox\\fidget spinner\" # Create a new export folder with a dynamic name using the current folder mkdir \"$name-export-$date\" # Export all SolidWorks part files to the new folder as STEP files export -search %.sldprt -directory \"$name-export-$date\" -extensions stp -name $namewithoutextension-$yyyy-$mm-$dd # Change to the newly created export folder cd \"$name-export-$date\" # Add the exported files to the vault as stp files are NOT automatically added addtovault -source \" \" # Check in all files in the current folder checkin -search % # Open the folder in File Explorer start . Script Annotations cd \"\\api\\sandbox\\fidget spinner\": Changes the current working directory to the specified path. mkdir \"$name-export-$date\": Creates a new folder with a dynamic name based on the current date and the folder name. export: Exports all .sldprt files in the current directory to the newly created folder as .stp files, appending the current date to the file names. cd \"$name-export-$date\": Changes the working directory to the newly created export folder. addtovault: Adds the exported files to the vault. checkin: Checks in all files in the current folder to the vault. start .: Opens the current folder in File Explorer. Comments Lines that start with # are ignored. Executing a Script There are two ways to execute a .pdmshell script: 1. Using pdmcli.exe You can execute a script using the pdmcli.exe command-line tool. Provide the script file as the first argument, wrapped in quotes if the file path contains spaces. Example Command pdmcli.exe \"C:\\Scripts\\example.pdmshell\" The pdmcli.exe tool can be found in the installation folder under Program Files (x86)\\BLUE BYTE SYSTEMS INC. 2. Using the runscript Command You can also execute scripts directly from the PDMShell console using the runscript command. [Note] Example Command runscript -source \"C:\\Scripts\\example.pdmshell\" Note For more information about the runscript command, refer to the runscript documentation. Workflow Integration For users with the Premium Version of PDMShell, pdmcli.exe can be hooked into workflow transitions. This allows scripts to be executed automatically as part of a workflow, enabling seamless automation of complex processes. Remarks Scripts are a powerful way to automate repetitive tasks and enforce consistency in workflows. Since .pdmshell files are plain text, they can be created and edited using any text editor. Ensure the script file is saved with the .pdmshell extension for proper execution. Use comments (#) in scripts to document the purpose of each command for better readability.

    "summary": "Notes About Running PDMShell Scripts from Workflow Transitions When you want to run PDMShell scripts as part of a workflow transition in SOLIDWORKS PDM, you can configure the transition to execute scripts seamlessly. This allows you to automate complex tasks during transitions, such as updating variables, exporting files, or triggering external processes. Workflow Transition Configuration Action Type: Set the action type to Execute Command. Command: Specify the path to the PDMShell executable, which is pdmcli.exe. \"path_to_pdmcli.exe\" runscript \"pathToScript\" [additional parameters] The pathToScript must be wrapped in quotes (\"\") if it contains spaces. Additional parameters can be passed to the script as needed aslo wrapped in quotes (\"\"). Make to sure to check Wait until the started program terminates. Example: Workflow Transition Execute Command Configuration \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\BLUE BYTE SYSTEMS INC\\PDMShell\\PDMCLI.exe\" runscript \"C:\\Scripts\\clearvariables.pdmshell\" \"FilePath\" Example Script In the PDMShell script (clearvariables.pdmshell), you can reference the parameters as follows: # Check the selected file out checkout -filePath \"$parameter1$\" # clear description variable setvar -filePath \"$parameter1$\" -variableName Description -Value \"\" # Save changes checkin -filePath \"$parameter1$\" -comment \"cleared description\" # cd to root folder cd\\ # cd to logs folder cd logs # save log dump clearvariables_$yyyy-$mm-$dd_$guid.txt # You must call quit at the end of the script quit Tutorial Tips for Running PDMShell Scripts from Workflow Transitions Test Your Scripts: Always test your PDMShell scripts independently before integrating them with workflow transitions. Use Quotes for Paths: Wrap paths and parameters in quotes (\"\") if they contain spaces to avoid errors."
