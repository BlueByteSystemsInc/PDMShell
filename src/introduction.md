### Using the Help System

PDMShell provides a comprehensive help system and detailed command documentation to guide you through its features. Here's how to get started:

- To view a list of all available commands, type:
  ```bash
  help
  ```
- To get detailed information about a specific command, type:
  ```bash
  help -command <command>
  ```
  For example:
  ```bash
  help -command cd
  ```

### Understanding the Command Documentation Structure
Each command page in PDMShell documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. **DESCRIPTION**: A brief explanation of what the command does.
2. **SYNTAX**: The syntax for using the command, including required and optional parameters.
3. **PARAMETERS**: A detailed explanation of each parameter, including whether it is required or optional.
4. **EXAMPLES**: Practical examples of how to use the command.
5. **REMARKS**: Additional notes, tips, or special considerations for using the command.
6. **TUTORIAL**: A short video tutorial demonstrating the command in action (if available).

### Example Command Documentation
Hereâ€™s an example of how a command is documented:

#### CD Command Documentation

**DESCRIPTION**:  
Changes the current PDM directory.

**SYNTAX**:  
```bash
cd [-directory|-id]
```

**PARAMETERS**:  
- `directory`: The directory to switch to. The directory parameter can be a relative or absolute path in PDM.  
- `id`: ID of the folder to navigate to.

**EXAMPLES**:  
```bash
cd -directory 'C:\Vault\NewFolder' # Navigates to NewFolder
cd -id 755 # Navigates to the folder with ID 755
```

**REMARKS**:  
- Use `cd..` to navigate to the parent folder or `cd\` to navigate to the root of the vault.  
- If you just created a new folder and want to `cd` to it using autocomplete, use the `dir` command with the `-refresh` parameter to reload the session.  
- `directory` is the default parameter, so you donâ€™t need to specify it if itâ€™s the only parameter in your command.
