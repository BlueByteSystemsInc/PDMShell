- Variable management
- User authentication
- Workflow automation

## ðŸ’¡ Why Use the Command Line Instead of File Explorer?

Working with the command line offers several advantages over traditional file explorer interfaces:

1. **Speed**: Perform bulk operations (e.g., renaming, moving, or deleting files) much faster than using a graphical interface.
2. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks with scripts, saving time and reducing human error.
3. **Precision**: Execute commands with exact parameters, ensuring consistent results.
5. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with other tools, scripts, or workflows for enhanced productivity.

For example, instead of manually navigating through folders in File Explorer to check out multiple files, you can use a single PDMShell command to check out all files in a specific folder or matching a pattern.

Here are some practical scenarios where PDMShell shines:

- **File Check-ins and Check-outs**:  
  Manage file versions by checking files in and out of the PDM vault directly from the command line, enabling efficient collaboration and version control.

- **Variable Management**:  
  Update and manage custom properties or metadata (e.g., part numbers, descriptions, revision levels) for multiple files in bulk.

- **Workflow Automation**:  
  Automate state transitions, approvals, and notifications to streamline processes like design reviews or release approvals.

- **Advanced Search**:  
  Locate files or folders quickly using powerful search filters, such as file names, metadata, or workflow states.

- **Folder Management**:  
  Create, rename, move, or delete folders in the PDM vault directly from the command line.

- **File Renaming**:  
  Perform bulk renaming of files based on patterns or rules, saving time and ensuring consistency.

- **File Moving and Copying**:  
  Move or copy files between folders or vaults efficiently, even in bulk operations.

- **Version Management**:  
  Access and manage file versions, including retrieving older versions or promoting specific versions to the latest.

- **Batch Processing**:  
  Execute operations like setting variables, checking in/out files, or renaming across multiple files or folders in one command.

- **Integration with Scripts**:  
  Combine PDMShell commands with external scripts or tools to create custom workflows tailored to your business needs.

- **Audit and Reporting**:  
  Generate reports on file activities, workflow states, or user actions for auditing and tracking purposes.

- **File Deletion and Cleanup**:  
  Automate the deletion of obsolete or unused files to maintain a clean and organized PDM vault.
