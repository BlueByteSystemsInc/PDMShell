Welcome to **PDMShell**, the command-line interpreter designed specifically for **SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional**. PDMShell provides engineers and IT professionals with a powerful and flexible tool for automating and streamlining tasks within the SOLIDWORKS PDM environment. By integrating command-line functionality, PDMShell allows users to perform routine PDM operations quickly, efficiently, and with greater control over their PDM data management processes.

### What is PDMShell?

PDMShell is a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) for **SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional** that simplifies file management, automation, and configuration tasks. It offers an extensive set of commands that can be used for common operations such as file check-ins and check-outs, variable management, user authentication, and much more.
